/* 

COMMENTS FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:

This works just fine, and you did an especially nice job of splitting up
the code into some coherent static methods--nice application of that 
strategy. It looks like maybe you didn't get to implement the default
(Y/n) strategy, in which the user can just hit [Enter] to indicate the
default (capitalized) response. Otherwise, nice work!

SCORE: 15/15
